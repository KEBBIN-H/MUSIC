<p>Music is joy. Its emotional. Music is a language that breaks all barriers. Its always fascinated me how many social, language, and background barriers music can break and really bring people together.</p>
<p>Ive been listening to music my whole life from bachata, rap, to rock, metal, jazz, funk. My music tatse list goes on and on much like how the posobilities of making music are endless. I think about how I used to think of music back then and take a look at how i think about it now and my views on it have drastically changed. I have a greater appreciation and understand more about it. Not only that but i frequently now come up with small tiny tunes in my head ever since i began playin on the drum set.</p>
